# GoldGdt
GoldGdt intends to be an accurate port of the GoldSrc movement code into Godot 4.

This is meant to act as a foundation to build a project on, as it comes pre-bundled with mapped inputs and the like.

## How to use

After extracting the files you will want to open the .project file through Godot, from there you can change names and begin working on your project!

## Plans

GoldGdt is not in a feature complete state as of writing, right now what is missing is:
- Water Movement
- Ladder Movement
- Crouch Animation

And, in broad strokes, what is contained is:
- Quake/GoldSrc Acceleration
- Ducking
- Jumping
- Surfing

If you have any issues or suggestions, please relay those to me!

Once this project is considered fully feature complete, I will work towards turning GoldGdt into a plugin for increased ease of use!
